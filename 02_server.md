## Sync your tdos and get notified.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tdolist/tdo-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tdolist/tdo-server)

This is what we are working on right now. We started to write a Django Web Server that will provide a Web UI and an API for your local _tdo_ installation.
Our goal is to offer a way to sync your tdos across multiple devices and get mail notifications for certain tdos on your list.

Currently, this project is **in-dev**. You can check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/tdolist/tdo-server)!
